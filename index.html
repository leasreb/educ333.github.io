            In recent years, the debate surrounding the impact of video games on social behavior has garnered significant attention from scholars and the general public alike. While traditional viewpoints often paint video games as isolating activities that detract from real-world social interactions, emerging research suggests a more nuanced perspective. This website aims to explore and display the multifaceted role of video games in enhancing social interaction and promoting the formation of meaningful relationships. Drawing upon the insights from three scholarly articles—Maitland et al.'s examination of active video games, Perry et al.'s investigation into the dynamics of online friendships, and Jensen's study on the influence of video games on prosocial behavior—we can see the ways in which video games, particularly through multiplayer platforms, serve as catalysts for socialization. By synthesizing findings from these studies, this site aims to present how video games can both reflect and shape social interactions in contemporary society. <strong>Click through the tabs above to learn more!</strong>

            <p>Welcome to my exploration of the intersection of video games and social interaction! I'm Lea and I am from Miami, Florida. I am currently a Junior at the Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information studying Information Analytics. I've always been fascinated by the power of technology to shape our lives. This project is my journey into uncovering the social potential of video games. Join me as I delve into research and insights to unravel the complexities of gaming as a social platform. Together, let's explore how gaming fosters communication, collaboration, and meaningful relationships in society. </p>
